            <p>Ok, so what is this site? This site is basically a test site (as shown from the url) that I decided to code because I wanted to code it. I'm also working on another game with xWafl called <a href="xwafl.github.io/test13" target="_blank">Test 13</a>. This site is just for testing, so do whatever you want with it. </p>
            <p style="margin-top: -22px;">Right now I'm coding thse words offline because I'm in the car. I'll upload those things later (Meaning I already have). <span title="plz don't get worked up about the way I spelled it. That's just how I spell it lol">Alot</span> of the stuff in the "Here" section will explain why else I made this site as well. And there's quite a bit on this page that I'm going to share.</p>
